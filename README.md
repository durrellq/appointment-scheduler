### Real-World Context

Many small businesses in our communities (barbershops, hair salons, consultants, tutors, etc.) struggle with appointment scheduling. Your app will help these entrepreneurs:

- Manage their availability
- Allow clients to book appointments
- Reduce no-shows with reminders
- Track client information

This project directly relates to employable skills in the tech industry while supporting local business owners.
